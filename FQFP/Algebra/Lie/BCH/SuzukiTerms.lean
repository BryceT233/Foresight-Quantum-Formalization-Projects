# The quintic Suzuki combination of binary commutators

The eight quadratic scalar polynomials use a representation with zero coefficients
at zero-based indices `2` and `6`. They are reduced using `4p³ + (1 - 4p)³ = 0`.
Their linear combination is defined for every parameter in an arbitrary field algebra;
its identification with the five-stage Strang logarithm requires cubic cancellation.

## Main definitions

* `suzukiQuinticCoeff`: the eight signed coefficient polynomials.
* `suzukiQuinticTerm`: their linear combination of the binary quintic commutators.
